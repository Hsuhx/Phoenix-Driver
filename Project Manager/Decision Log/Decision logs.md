## Take our team members‚Äô role allocation as an example
Using the general decision-making process, let‚Äôs evaluate the allocation of roles within the Phoenix Drive project team:

Context and Information Gathering: The project requires a variety of roles filled by team members with specific skills and aspirations. Information about each member's past experiences and interests was collected.

Evaluating Options:

Kunlun Zang's experience in the COMP 8715 course aligns well with the leadership required for a Project Manager.
Fei Wang's extensive professional experience suits the administrative and organizational demands of a Project Administrator.
Xiaotong Chen‚Äôs history with multiple development projects matches the oversight needed for a Technical Supervisor.
Zeyi Liu and Chunrui Tao‚Äôs expertise and career aspirations in front-end development make them ideal for Frontend Developers.
Xinrui Zhang and Haoxuan Xu's passion and proficiency in backend frameworks fit well with the technical demands of Backend Developers.
Selection:

Each team member was assigned to roles where their individual strengths and career goals could be best utilized, ensuring effective project execution and personal satisfaction.
Implementation: Roles were communicated to each team member, establishing clear responsibilities and expectations.

Review: The team will continue to receive feedback on role suitability and project progression, ready to make adjustments as needed to optimize team performance and project success.

This structured decision-making process ensures that each member of the Phoenix Drive project is placed in a role that not only fits their skills but also aligns with their professional aspirations, thereby maximizing both individual and team effectiveness.

## Status Legend


| Status      | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| On Hold (‚è∏Ô∏è)       | This status is applied to tasks or decisions that have started but are temporarily paused. The reasons for the hold can vary, including awaiting resources, decisions from higher management, or external dependencies.       |
| Not Started (‚ùå)|  Indicates tasks or decisions that have been identified but have not yet begun. This status is useful for tracking planned activities that are pending initiation.        |
| In Progress (üïí)       | This status is used for tasks or decisions that are currently being worked on. It shows that actions have been initiated but are not yet complete. This can include ongoing development, discussions, or any continuous activities.                  |
| Completed (‚úîÔ∏è)        | This status indicates that a task or decision has been fully executed and no further action is required. It signifies that objectives have been met and the outcomes are satisfactory.                   |
## Decision Type 

|  Category  | Description                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Critical       | These decisions have the most significant impact on the overall success and direction of a project or organization. They often involve substantial resources, risk, and have long-term implications. Critical decisions require thorough analysis and input from top management or key stakeholders. |
| Major      | Major decisions are important but not as far-reaching as critical decisions. They typically concern the operational aspects of larger strategies and require good judgment to align with broader organizational goals.       |
| Minor      | Minor decisions are less critical and often deal with day-to-day operational activities. They are usually straightforward, require less formal processes, and can often be delegated to individual team members. Minor decisions are important for the smooth functioning of any project but typically do not have long-lasting impacts. |
| Routine      | Routine decisions are repetitive and predictable, usually requiring standard responses. These are the lowest in terms of strategic importance and can often be automated or made according to established guidelines or policies. |

Everyone had no clear understanding of the project and did not know what role they should play in the project. | We followed our own decision-making process, worked together as a team, analyzed the situation, and finally determined the division of labor among team members.| 28/07/2024 | Completed (‚úîÔ∏è)  | Team |
