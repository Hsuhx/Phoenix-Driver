## Goal of the MVP
The goal of this semester is to build a designated driver system that realizes basic functions and strive to realize the basic facial recognition driver function to better ensure the safety of passengers.We also conducted some research on Australiaâ€™s data security and whether facial recognition and platform collection of user data are feasible in Australia. We also explored whether the project could be deployed in Australia.
